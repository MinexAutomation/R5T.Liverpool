Service Builders:

* ServiceProvider (not IServiceProvider) (DONE)
* Generic Host (DONE)
* Web Host (prior to .NET Core 3.0) (DONE)
* Console program-as-hosted-service.
* DbContextProvider

* An IBuildableService service builder (a general buildable service, which could have implementations for ServiceProvider, Generic host, Web host, etc.)
